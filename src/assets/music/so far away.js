[00:13.23]Light 'em up light 'em up
[00:15.21]Tell me where you are tell me where you are
[00:19.54]The summer nights the bright lights
[00:21.65]And the shooting stars they break my heart
[00:25.15]I'm calling you now but you're not picking up
[00:28.31]Your shadows so close if you are still in love
[00:32.47]Then light a match light a match
[00:34.55]Baby in the dark show me where you are
[00:37.87]Where you are
[00:39.69]Oh love
[00:41.30]How I miss you every single day
[00:43.29]When I see you on those streets
[00:46.11]Oh love
[00:47.69]Tell me there's a river I can swim
[00:49.70]That will bring you back to me
[00:52.33]'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
[00:55.61]I don't know how to forget your face
[00:59.02]Oh love
[01:00.59]God I miss you every single day
[01:02.47]And now you're so far away
[01:10.08]So far away
[01:17.43]It's breaking me I'm losing you
[01:19.66]We were far from perfect but we were worth it
[01:23.91]Too many fights and we cried
[01:25.92]But never said we're sorry
[01:27.79]Stop saying you love me
[01:29.56]You're calling me now but I can't pick up
[01:32.74]Your shadow's too close and I'm still in love
[01:36.42]The summer's over now but somehow
[01:38.60]It still breaks my heart
[01:40.45]We could have had the stars oh
[01:44.22]Oh love
[01:45.66]How I miss you every single day
[01:47.59]When I see you on those streets
[01:50.57]Oh love
[01:52.12]Tell me there's a river
[01:53.28]I can swim that will bring you back to me
[01:56.78]'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
[02:00.12]I don't know how to forget your face
[02:03.46]Oh love
[02:04.99]God I miss you every single day
[02:07.00]And now you're so far away
[02:14.47]So far away
[02:20.97]So far away
[02:25.04]Oh so far away
[02:33.69]So far away
[02:35.70]Oh love
[02:37.22]How I miss you every single day
[02:39.25]When I see you on those streets
[02:42.09]Oh love
[02:43.68]Tell me there's a river
[02:44.86]I can swim that will bring you back to me
[02:48.18]'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
[02:51.59]I don't know how to forget your face
[02:54.94]Oh love
[02:56.60]God I miss you every single day
[02:58.53]When you're so far away`
